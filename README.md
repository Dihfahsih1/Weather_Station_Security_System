The Wimea Weather Security System(WWSS) was an idea of three emphatic  and one ambitious young lady.  We came up with a low cost solution to address the problem of vandalism and theft of the various high cost weather equipment .

Theft and vandalism of these equipment has been on the rise lately due to their high demand on the local market.

Equipment like the solar panels are the most affected, they are taken for home use like lighting, cooking , ironing as well as phone charging.

The solution works with Automated weather stations installed country wide.  This helps to ease information dissemination , boost security and reduce chances of vandalism.

We are four main contributors to this project all pursuing software engineering at Makerere university.  we are a team of diverse talent . This has helped us to always hit the deadline on the various projects we have worked on as well as deliver standard work .

we are mentored by  DR. Julianne SANSA OTIM,  Mary NSABAGWA , Milton WAISSWA. These are some of the smartest brains behind the high software development skills that flows out of the Faculty of Computing and Information Sciences.  This makes them the most outstanding software developers, mentors, innovators as well as lecturers in the IT industry countrywide.
